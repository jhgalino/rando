# rando

A small Python script to randomly select a task from a [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/)

## Installation

Clone the repo, then install `requirements.txt`. I like compiling this using PyInstaller but you can run the script directly too. 

## Usage

Use `python src/main.py <location of todo.txt>` to get a task from your todo.txt. The `-i <project> ...` flag makes it so that no tasks are taken from the specified projects.
